This is iteration 1 code for the Fly Fighters website.

Fly Fighters is a project developed by a team of 4 Monash students who aim to create a customised platform for every orchard farmer of Western Australia to defend their fruits from Medfly attacks.

Project Description:
	Farmers in Western Australia are helpless in protecting their farmland from Mediterranean Fruit Fly (Medfly) facing the 	issues of crop loss and export restriction leading to heavy financial drain.The reason it is challenging for the farmers 	is the fruit fly getting unnoticed and the major problem is the difficulty in predicting when the fruit fly would be 		active.

	The website aims at providing two important functionalities to the farmers:

	Predict the potential presence of Medfly in a particular location based on climatic condition.
	Develop a recommendation system which would help farmers decide when to use which control/preventive measures based on 	their farm, time of crop harvesting, season.
	The website aims at lowering the burden of the farmers by helping them in finding solutions exclusive to their scenario.
